```sh
make
```

### 2. Run the Game
After compiling, start the game using:
```sh
make run
```

### 3. Create a JAR File

```sh
make create-jar
```

### 4. Run the JAR File
Once the JAR file is created, you can run the game with:
```sh

```

## Project Structure

â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Main.java
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Sound.java

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure your Java version is up to date by running:
  ```sh
  java -version
  ```
- If you encounter issues with sound files, make sure they are located in the correct `assets/Sound/` folder.
- Check the `Makefile` for any incorrect paths or configurations.
